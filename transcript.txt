i think we can all agree that streamlit
is an amazing framework it is so
flexible and you can build many
different types of web apps with it so
in this video i want to share with you
my nine most favorite streamlet
components number one for me is the
columns component the reason that i like
that one is i like using space a bit
more efficiently and with columns you
can put things side by side rather than
one after another on the screen yes one
nice thing about the columns component
is that you can decide their relative
sizes so if you just want to have two
columns you can type two when you're
calling to
when you're calling the columns
component and then it will create two
columns of the same size but if you need
them to be a little bit different than
each other you can say the first one
will have the size ratio of one the
second one two and the last one one so
what it will do is to create first
column uh half the size as the middle
column and the last column also half the
size as a middle column and we will see
how that looks in a second also so and
it's very easy to assign it to some
variables
so this is the first thing that i really
enjoy when i'm using streamlit of course
we will not see anything if we run this
application right now it's just three
columns so let me populate this with
some of my other favorite components so
that we can see how it looks the second
one that i really enjoy is markdown and
the reason i like using markdown is
because i'm kind of used to
writing a text in markdown format for
example when i'm preparing some
documentation on github uh that's why i
kind of like creating
headlines or lists etc when i in my
application so
it's very easy again you can call
streamlightmarkdown
and if you want to have a heading you
can just type it with
one hashtag or
i don't really know what else it's
called
let's say
you know we can say welcome to my
to my app and i can change that later
if
i want to have more in there
i can also say
here is some info
on the app
all right so let me put this actually in
the column
first column so that we can see what
that looks like
yeah so as you can see this is my first
column here will be my second column and
the last column will also be as big as
the first column next one i really like
is a file uploader and the reason that i
like this one is because sometimes you
really need to communicate with the user
and it is not enough to only have um you
know some text input or some other types
of input but you need something a bit
more sophisticated and when you have
people upload a file it can be anything
for example if you're doing a data
science project they can even upload a
whole new data set so that's why i
really like the file uploader component
of streamlit
let me put this in the second column
in this one i will ask people to
um do a photo upload
upload a photo
and you can easily also save it into a
variable when a photo or a file is
uploaded so i will just say
uploaded photo for this one
and let's see how that looks yeah as you
can see you know we need a bit more
space for this one that's why i made the
column a little bit bigger but if you
want to upload something you just say
browse files and then automatically
upload it next thing that i really like
again i will put it in the second column
is the camera input so instead of
writing a text or uploading a photo you
can also automatically grab photos from
the webcam that you have which is in my
opinion really useful sometimes
especially if you are making a project a
web app that has something to do with
computer vision that could be a very fun
application it could be a very fun way
of making your web app a bit more
interactive
and again we need to tell people what to
do you can say take a photo
and again you can save the photo that is
taken
into a variable so i'll just call this
camera photo
let's see what that looks like
of course you need to then give
permission for the streaming application
to access your camera and hey that's me
hello
and you can take a photo and then it
will just show your photo here and then
the photo will be saved into this
variable that you defined next thing
that i really like is when you have
someone do something on your app if it's
an interactive application then it is
very nice to show them some feedback if
something failed or not and stream it
already has built-in components or boxes
for
to do this so for example if you want
people to take a photo and then you want
something to happen you know if that
thing happens and you show a result
people might not really understand that
something happened in the background so
it's always a good idea to give them a
little bit of a feedback so one thing
you can do again let's say it's about
uploading a photo or taking a photo
you can say you can use the success box
and give them a message for example
photo
uploaded
successfully
and here now we can see that for shows
me the photo uploaded successfully of
course you can uh have a little
condition here that says show this only
if the photo is uploaded or a new photo
is being taken but we'll do that in a
second but for now as you can see it's
nice to show something with a little
green background that tells the user
that everything went well and sometimes
you might need to show people that
something is working in the background
or maybe like a little progress bar to
show them hey we're working on this and
we will get back to you in a second so
maybe it's after uploading a photo or
uploading a file maybe if it's too big
it's taking a little bit of time so what
you can do is to show this progress bar
and that is also built in and streamless
and i i really really like it one really
easy way to do it let's say i put it in
the second column again
i'll call progress component from
streamlet and at first it's going to be
zero
and then inside a for loop
completed
i can increase it a little bit so for
example of course i give this a name
um
progress bar
and then i will include increase this
incrementally if you don't want it to
happen really fast of course you can
also add some sleeping time in here
just need to call
the time
module and yeah this will work so it
will basically look like it's slowly
being uploaded so let's see how that
looks
oh i forgot to give sleep some
um
let's say 0.5 let's not wait too long
oh turns out that this is taking a long
0.05 maybe
i'll rerun this and yeah as you can see
now we have a nice little smooth uh
progress bar and once it's done it will
give me a
success message
the next thing that i really like is how
you can show some of the metrics on
stream with applications they have a
really nice little neat way of showing
them for example if i want to add this
to column three
we'll just call metric
i need to give it a label let's say i
want to show the temperature
and the value of it is
60
degrees celsius
and let's say there's also a delta to it
a change to it and that is
three degrees celsius so
let's see how nice that looks if we
rerun this
yeah as you can see it is very nice then
we can show the delta in a neat way and
if it's positive it shows as green if
it's negative it shows us
uh
red so that's a nice way of showing
things without you having to um
format everything from scratch having
this a little bit bigger having this a
bit smaller have a different color or
add a little icon here so that's quite
neat another thing that i really enjoy
is expanders in streamlight because it
really saves from time
a lot you don't if you have a lot of
text you don't have to show the text in
one place you can just divide it into
expanders and people can
click them if they want to read more
about a certain topic so i'll just add
that
separately
i will say width streamlit
expender and the nice thing is it's very
neatly organized that's what i like so
you put the title of the expander here
inside the expander component so you can
say click to read
more for example
and then you can add whatever you want
in there
that's the nice thing
uh what should i say
hello here are more
details on this topic
that
you were
interested
in you can add other things you can add
lists or you can even add some of the
images so we can put the image that
we've just
taken for example
camera
photo oops
but that might give me an error
but maybe we can say
if
uploaded
photo
is none
then we show the camera photo
so we'll see the user will do one thing
else
will show
the other photo
the uploaded photo this is assuming i
haven't written that in but this is
assuming that you know we have uh one
photo or the other photo uploaded
already so let's see how that looks
all right click to read more and then it
opens up and then we can read more and
then we also have our nice little image
here and the last thing that i really
enjoy with streamlet is the session
states and the callback function so
that's why i wasn't sure if it was nine
or ten if you call if you think of them
as one thing it's nine but if it goes
about separate things and it's ten
basically session states and callback
functions makes streamline applications
much much much better much easier to use
and opens up so many possibilities for
us so for example if i want to keep
track of if a photo has been uploaded or
not
what i can do is to have
a
photo
session state basically so i'll say the
photo
not in streamlet
session stage
streamlight session
state
photo and at first this is how it's
going to be initialized
of course it's going to be
let's say
not done
and what i can do is to have a callback
function and inside this function i'm
going to change the session state
when a photo is either uploaded or a
photo has been taken so i will say
change
photo
state
and then in here i'm going to change the
state
to done
and to
have this any effect
have this have any effect i need to call
on change so if something happens here
i will call change for the state
callback function
here
and here
and then i can also say you know we've
been showing the progress and the
percentage completed everything
everything so maybe i can say if
not this
streamlination state
is done then do all of these things if
not then don't do anything
so let's see how that's going to look
all right i'll rerun my application
all right so right now nothing is
happening it just says welcome to my app
here's some info on the app whatever we
can add whatever we want there if i
upload something
um
let's say
one of my photos
it will break because i accidentally
called
strings here and not the
function name sorry let's
start this again
as i said nothing is happening now i
will just upload a photo here
and then we see the progress bar
and then it will show me a success
message
and we will also be able to see the
temperature
then we see this here and then we see
the uploaded image so
yeah that's how session states and
callback functions help us
and yeah this has been 9 or 10 depends
on how you look at it
of my favorite stream with components i
hope this helped to give you some of the
inspiration that i've got with
streamless they have so many different
types of components so many things you
can do with them
and it would really depend on the kind
of project that you're working on but
i've also found that the components
themselves sometimes give me inspiration
for a whole new
project that you can make a interactive
web application on
so i hope you liked it if you have any
questions about any of the components
let me know or if you want to learn more
about the components that i talked about
here again let me know i can make a
video separately
on them in the future have a great day
for now and i will see you in the next
video
